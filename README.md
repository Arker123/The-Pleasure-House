# The-Pleasure-House
(A blockchain-based restaurant website )
Introduction
The Pleasure House is a blockchain-based web application where the reviews given by the  customers on the food items will be stored in a blockchain. This is done so that the restaurant cannot tamper with the reviews. The overall average review rating of a food item will be uploaded in real-time and the customers can choose what to order according to the average ratings which will be visible to them while ordering food. As soon as the customer finishes eating, he will be asked to give a review which again will be stored in a block of the blockchain. This system ensures that : 
1. The review given by customers cannot be tampered with by the restaurant even if they try to do so.
2. Everybody gives a review.
3. The average review available to the customers makes the choice of ordering food easier.
